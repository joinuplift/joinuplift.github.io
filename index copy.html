                        <p><b>Over 500 million people live on less than 75 cents a day.</b> Families are living without adequate housing, access to education, and health care. Often, there is little or no clean water or safe nutritious food. Women and their children often carry the heaviest burden of poverty. As a result, families in extreme poverty cannot take advantage of most social programs and are excluded from their communities. </p><br/>

                        <p>Fortunately we now have a solution that works for women and families: receiving stabilizing support for basic needs, learning marketable skills to start small businesses, and re-entering their communities through social inclusion programs.  With this comprehensive approach, we are permanently breaking the cycle of poverty and opening up new possibilities for those who need it most.</p><br/>

                        <p><b>Create a breakthrough suite of technology</b>, tools and training that will ensure that organizations and governments implementing Graduation programs have what they need to deploy effective ground teams, achieving results at scale.</p><br/>

                        <p class="bold">We created Uplift out of a strong desire to help end extreme poverty within our lifetime.</p><br/>

                        <p>In our search for proven solutions, we learned about the Graduation approach pioneered by BRAC. Graduation programs stood out as the most cost effective and transformative approach to permanently overcome the harshest conditions of extreme poverty. After seeing the potential of this program to change the lives of families, we had to act. Working together, Amplifier, Erol Foundation and BRAC created a vision for a global movement to unite philanthropists with governments and catalyze new organizations to bring the Graduation approach to those who need it most.</p><br/>

                        <p>Erol Foundation and Michael and Xochi Birch are the angel investors behind Uplift, funding global operations. With support from investors like them, every dollar Uplift raises will be given to Graduation programs around the world. We are rapidly growing through new partnerships, and we need your support.
