## Women are the key to sustainable development


The trajectory of poverty alleviation is a long one, and while some organizations focus solely on social protection programs or microfinance, Sir Abed described the importance of providing “disruptive” approaches to the plight of poverty. BRAC’s unique response led to the creation of the Graduation approach designed to increase the social and economic capital of the world’s poorest families.

### Seventy cents a day

The Graduation approach empowers families living on less than 70 cents a day to transition out of ultra-poverty through a series of carefully sequenced interventions—giving these families the skills and confidence to improve their livelihoods, participate in mainstream development activities, and maintain an upward economic trajectory.

The typical participant in BRAC’s program is a woman, often a widow, raising two or more children, unable to afford a sufficient meal (consisting of a mixture of rice and water), working as a day laborer, and isolated from mainstream development programs. These women are in a cyclical “reproduction of poverty” according to Abed, unable to escape from or improve upon their circumstances.
