## An interview with BRAC’s Sir Fazle Hasan Abed

“Women are the managers of poverty, in the sense that women manage poor households, looking after the children, their food, their needs, If the managers of poverty are women, why not also managers of development?” said  founder and chairperson of BRAC Sir Fazle Hasan Abed to students at the Yale School of Management on September 30.”

Sir Abed spoke on “Leading Development in Bangladesh” as part of Yale SOM’s Leaders Forum lecture series, which brings global CEOs and heads of organizations to campus to speak with students.

BRAC’s approach has proven successful, making the organization the world’s largest NGO with an annual budget exceeding $700M, 80% of which is generated from its social enterprises. In Freedom from Want, Ian Smillie calls BRAC “undoubtedly the largest and most variegated social experiment in the developing world. The spread of its work dwarfs any other private, government or non-profit enterprise in its impact on development.”
